# Cursor Rules - Personal AI Automations

## Project Intelligence

This file captures patterns, preferences, and project-specific insights that help maintain consistency across sessions.

### Project Structure
- **Monorepo Pattern**: Each automation lives in its own subdirectory (e.g., `jobs/`)
- **Self-Contained**: Each automation includes its own requirements.txt, README, and logs/
- **Memory Bank**: All project documentation in `memory-bank/` directory
- **Virtual Environments**: Use venv for Python dependency isolation

### Coding Patterns

#### Python Scripts
- Use Python 3.12+ as the standard
- Include docstrings for all functions
- Graceful error handling with try/except blocks
- Detailed logging to timestamped files
- Configuration at the top of files (clearly marked)

#### Configuration Management
- Sensitive data (API keys, emails) in `.env` files
- Environment variables loaded with `os.environ.get()` with sensible defaults
- `.env.example` templates for new automations
- Never commit `.env` files

#### Web Scraping
- Always use respectful delays (2-3 seconds between requests)
- User-Agent headers to identify the bot properly
- Graceful handling of HTML structure changes
- Limit results per search to avoid overwhelming APIs

#### Notification Systems
- **Desktop Notifications (macOS)**: Use osascript for native notifications
- **HTML Reports**: Generate beautiful standalone HTML files for detailed viewing
- Only notify when new content is found (prevent duplicate notifications)
- Keep notification messages concise (detailed info in HTML file)
- Auto-open HTML files in browser for immediate review

### Security Practices
- ✅ Use environment variables for all secrets
- ✅ Keep `.env` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Provide `.env.example` templates
- ⚠️ Verify sender emails in SendGrid before use

### State Management
- JSON files for simple persistence (e.g., `sent_jobs.json`)
- Keep state files small (auto-prune old entries)
- No database needed for current scale
- State files in same directory as script

### Automation Scheduling
- **macOS**: Use cron for scheduling
- **Wrapper Scripts**: Shell scripts for cron (handles PATH, logging, etc.)
- **Log Files**: Always redirect output to timestamped logs
- **Frequency**: Twice daily (9 AM, 6 PM) for job searches

### File Organization
```
automations/
├── memory-bank/           # Project documentation (6 core files)
├── .cursorrules          # This file
├── .gitignore            # Ignore venv/, .env, logs/
├── LICENSE               # MIT License
└── [automation-name]/    # Each automation is self-contained
    ├── README.md         # Automation-specific docs
    ├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
    ├── .env.example      # Environment variable template
    ├── main_script.py    # Primary automation logic
    ├── run_*.sh          # Cron wrapper script
    ├── state.json        # State tracking (auto-generated)
    └── logs/             # Execution logs (auto-generated)
```

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing before adding to cron
- Check logs regularly (weekly minimum)
- Monitor SendGrid quota usage
- Validate HTML emails before deploying

### Documentation Standards
- Every automation needs a README
- Memory Bank files updated when architecture changes
- `activeContext.md` updated with current focus
- `progress.md` tracks what works and what's next

### User Context
- **Role**: Engineering leadership (Director, VP, Manager)
- **Skills**: React, TypeScript, Node.js, AI/ML, Team Leadership
- **Location**: Winter Springs, FL (50-mile radius)
- **Preferences**: Remote positions, EdTech/Education sector
- **Email**: bisike.nnadi@gmail.com

### Known Challenges
1. **Web Scraping Fragility**: Job board HTML changes frequently
   - Solution: Fallback gracefully, log errors, continue with other sources
   
2. **Rate Limiting**: Avoid overwhelming job boards
   - Solution: Respectful delays, limit results per search
   
3. **Email Deliverability**: SendGrid requires verified senders
   - Solution: Verify sender in SendGrid dashboard before use

4. **Cron Environment**: Limited PATH and env vars
   - Solution: Shell wrapper scripts with full paths

### Recent Changes (November 28, 2025)
- **Jobs Automation**: Migrated from SendGrid email to desktop notifications + HTML reports
  - Removed SendGrid dependency (simpler, free, no API keys needed)
  - Added macOS native notification support
  - Generate beautiful HTML reports with auto-open in browser
  - Benefits: Instant notifications, no inbox clutter, fully local & private

### Future Automation Ideas
- Google Sheets integration for job tracking
- Newsletter summarization (daily digest)
- Calendar optimization (meeting analytics)
- Financial tracking (expense categorization)
- Learning resource aggregation (curated content)
- Social media content scheduling

### Maintenance Reminders
- Review logs weekly for errors
- Prune old log files monthly
- Check SendGrid quota monthly
- Update Memory Bank when adding new automations
- Test scrapers after job board UI changes
